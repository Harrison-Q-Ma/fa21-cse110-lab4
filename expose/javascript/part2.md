1. Line 12 will print the number 3. 
2. Line 13 will print the number 150.
3. Line 14 will print ```NaN```. 
4. The function returns a list ```[ NaN, NaN, NaN ]```. This is because __INSERT_EXPLAINATION_HERE__
5. Line 12 will cause an error 
   > `i is not defined`

   This is because ```i``` is declared within the scope of the for loop and cannot be accessed outside of it. 
6. Line 13 will cause an error
   > `discountedPrice is not defined`

   This is because ```discountedPrice``` is declared within the scope of the for loop and cannot be accessed outside of it. 
7. Line 14 will print ```NaN```.
8. The function returns a list ```[ NaN, NaN, NaN ]```. This is because __INSERT_EXPLAINATION_HERE__
9. Line 11 will cause an error 
   > `i is not defined`

   This is because ```i``` is declared within the scope of the for loop and cannot be accessed outside of it. 
10. Line 12 will print the number 3. 
11. This function will return a list `[ 50, 100, 150 ]`. This is because __INSERT_EXPLAINATION_HERE__

    3. `true` 
    4. `true`
    5. `false`
    6. `true` 
15. `==` checks for value equality and does type coercion. `===` checks for value equality without doing type coercion.

17. The printed result will be `[ 2, 4, 6 ]`. In each iteration of the for loop, we are pushing to `newArr` the result of applying `doSomething()` to the current element of the original array, which multiplies it by 2.
